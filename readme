This is collection of some of the deep learning projects which i have created for begineers (Even i am also a begineer ;-) ). I am starting with basic tutorials which 
will cover a lot of concepts like CNN, RNN , YOLO etc for many tasks like object recognition, segmentation, tracking objects and Cars  and FINALLY build 
deep predictive coding networks.
